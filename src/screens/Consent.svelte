          This project is being conducted by researchers from the department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA. This study aims to understand how individuals experience different feelings in response to narratives.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm mb-2">
          Your participation is voluntary. Participation involves periodically making behavioral judgments about how you are feeling in response to video/audio clips, pictures, and text excerpts. The clips will be from public radio or primetime television.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm mb-2">
          If you decide to take part in this study, you may be asked to view a variety of media that vary in emotional content. If any of the media presented should make you feel too uncomfortable to continue with the study, you are free to immediately withdraw your participation without giving up payment. To be clear: you may immediately end your participation if any aspect of the research procedure makes you too uncomfortable to continue. Lastly, if you have any discomfort or concerns after viewing the media, you are encouraged to contact the principal investigator at
